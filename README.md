Notes on getting the i.mx93 EVK running and updated on a new system

This is how to get up and running doing new builds for the i.MX93evk:
https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/i-mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i-mx-93-evaluation-kit:i.MX93EVK

First we're going to download a Linux platform to work on. I have had issues using the integrated WSL in the past so instead we're going to use Oracle Virtual box. 

Start by downloading Virtual box from The site:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_7_0

Note in this instance we're picking an older 7.0 version since the latest (7.0.16) has a warning on it that it crashes.
